//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];

console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];

console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
var removed = animals.splice(2, 1, "Gorilla")

console.log(animals) // ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Gorilla"]

// animals is ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Gorilla"]
// removed is ["Elephant"]

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Gorilla"];
var removed = animals.splice(2, 0, "Flamingo")

console.log(animals) // ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Flamingo", "Elephant", "Gorilla"]

// animals is ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Flamingo", "Elephant", "Gorilla"]
// removed is [], no elements removed

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Flamingo", "Gorilla"]
var total = animals.push("Elephant")

console.log(animals) //["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Flamingo", "Gorilla", "Elephant"]
console.log(total) // 5
//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corn"]

console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
var foods = ["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corn"]

console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
var foods = ["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corn"]
var total = foods.push("Broccoli")

console.log(foods) // ["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corn", "Broccoli"]
console.log(total) // 6

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
var foods = ["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corn", "Broccoli"]
var total = foods.pop("Broccoli")

console.log(foods) // ["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corn"]
console.log(total) // 5

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
var foods = ["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corn"]
var total = foods.push("Queso", "Coleslaw", "Bacon")

console.log(foods) //["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corns", "Queso", "Coleslaw", "Bacon"]
console.log(total) // 8

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
var foods = ["Potatoes", "Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corn", "Queso", "Coleslaw", "Bacon"]
var total = foods.shift("Potatoes")

console.log(foods) // [Carrots", "Tacos", "Ribs", "Corns", "Queso", "Coleslaw", "Bacon"]
console.log(total) // 7

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Pinterest: Arrays might be storing data in the different boards users create
// 2: Pinterest: Arrays might be storing data in the different tags uses attach to a post. These tags will
// also be used in arrays when a user searches a keyword or topic
// 3: A retailer site like ASOS.com. Arrays might be used when browsing, ie. shirts, skirts, etc. Arrays
// might also be used on a site like this when filtering a search, selecting a specific color or size.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

// console.log("Do you have enough of a charge?", percentBatteryLeft > 15);
// console.log("Do you have a charger?", hasCharger === true);
// console.log("What type of charger is it?", chargerType == "car");


var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

//have a charger, and that it is a car charger. Because code is true it is logged in console,
// and the subsequent code is ignored.

  //able to call uber.

//call an uber.
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;

if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15 || hasCharger == true || chargerType !== "car") {

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,

## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

This felt very frustrating at first. I realized I need to better employ taking breaks. After stepping away for a bit, usually taking time to do something active outside, I would be better able to see my mistakes or effectively google what I needed to do or change in my code.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Instagram: Arrays are employed in creating someone's posts on their profile feed. Something like "cute picture of dog", "picture of cocktails", "picture of desert landscape". The instruction performing to list each post in order.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

The Array method is a special type of variable that is able to store a list of values, instead of just a single value. It can be used in website searches, ie. when searching a specific hashtag on Pinterest or filtering a search on a clothing website to garner a specific search of color, style or size.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to give the same command multiple times so that you don't have to write out each line of code for each variable. We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we wanted to execute numbering the pages of a book.

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

You shouldn't use a loop with an array when you need more granular control. One construct can sometimes be totally different from the other.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Let's say you had magic powers and were able to give your stuffed animals instructions to make them dance. Instead of telling each stuffed animal how to do the dance, you give the first stuffed animal the instruction and that applies it to each animal so they all know how to do the same dance.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I found Arrays and loops to be fairly straight forward. I think I'm struggling more with if statements and could use more resources and exercises in that area.

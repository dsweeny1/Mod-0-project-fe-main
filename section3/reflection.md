## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

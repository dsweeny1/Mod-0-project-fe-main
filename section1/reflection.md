## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I think I sometimes ask them too soon and then get embarrassed so in reaction I'll wait to long the next time. I really like the 20 minute rule regarding getting stuck on something. I am trying to stay steadfast to this rule.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Number, String, Boolean
Number: regarding amounts, values, totals
String: This seems more to me to be a sentence. A way to gather multiple values and characters into one cohesive thought
Boolean: A way to determine the accuracy of the values we are working with

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var greeting = "Hello";
var target = "World";
console.log("greeting" + "target" + "!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You use // to begin a code comment. You use code comments to explain the 'what' and the 'why' of the code written, either for yourself or other devs that may work on your code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

* A variable stores information. We can assign variables what information we want it to store. We can then use that variable to input that information into our code.
* If I were explaining this to a 5 year old: Each of your markers stores a different color.
You can use these markers/colors to create what picture (information) you desire to
show the world, to create whatever is it you want to create.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Instagram
Three variables: likes, locations, bios
Liking something is like pressing a button, which in turn runs some code, recording
the number of likes the image receives. This might use interpolation. Once the image
is liked the code will update the number of likes recorded under the image.
Locations tagged on photos would have to interact with some kind of GPS system linked
in the app. Once you access said GPS your location on your photo is updated. This might use
the boolean dataType, to give the accurate location.
Bios are just a string to give a description of the individual should someone write a bio.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation joins together ideas. It does this by mergeing 2 or more strings.
In most cases it is the preferred method because it is typically more concise.
It takes separate commands and makes them into one cohesive action.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

ASOS.com
Concatenation could be employed when paring down a search of items. When you select
what colors, sizes, styles, etc. this is all feeding the website specific variables
commanding exactly what to show the shopper in their search.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am not completely certain my examples of variables and concatenation are correct.
I could use further instruction in how the code we're learning actually shows up
on various websites.

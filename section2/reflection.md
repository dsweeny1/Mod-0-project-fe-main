## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Although I had heard the term before, I don't think I knew exactly what "Growth Mindset" was as clearly as described in the video. I do feel as if I have been practicing this for years every since I began my journey with mindfulness. This practice taught me that life is just that, a practice. I learned to be more patient with myself and forgive myself when my skill set in this area has become a bit dull. I am finding myself on an almost daily rollercoaster this last week starting Turing. Going from feeling stupid for not knowing everything immediately to forgiving myself for getting so frustrated. I am trying to improve my skills when it comes to working with myself, rather than making myself work in a fashion of 'how I think I should'.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Currently I am recognizing when I'm in a fixed mindset, getting frustrated or panicky quickly, and realizing it's time to step away for a short break. I am working on slowing down my frantic mind to be more able to focus on one thing rather than panic about it. When I panic or get frustrated my eyes and mind begin to dart around the screen not finishing a thought or being fully present in what I'm doing.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

At first it felt frustrating. I'm trying to take in so much information so quickly part of me just wanted to be given that part. After I let those emotions pass over me though I remembered I am capable of figuring out what I can and asking for help when I can't figure something out. I think the way Turing is handling my education in coding is tremendously helpful and supportive. I want to have the confidence to try and solve something on my own. While also having the humility to receive help when that is the smarter, more efficient option.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is based on the concept of if/then/else. If a condition is met, then your code executes one or more statements, else your code does something different (or just skips a step). A daily life conditional might look like "If it rains tomorrow, we'll stay home." The app I used the most is Instagram. A conditional on Instagram might look like: if a photo is double tapped then it records a like, or if a story is viewed then the data gets recorded.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions you would use an Else ... If statement. This type of statement gives multiple options or choices throughout the code. Ie. If this than that, if not that than other that, etc. until one of the conditions evaluates true.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

This question makes me think of the decision-making exercise in this section. We had to evaluate multiple variables throughout the exercise. The value we gave to a variable at the beginning of the exercise also impacted the end of the story. And we were still able to change other values assigned to other variables later on in the code. So I would say that If ... Else statements is a tool available to developers, as well as, comparison operators and logical operators.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I learn through doing, seeing, and applying my knowledge. I feel like I have at least some sort of grasp on the concepts discussed in section 2 but I know I will get stronger and have more specific questions as we begin to apply them through projects.
